          Building a website is an exercise of willpower. The bells and whistles
          of the design process are tempting to focus on, but compelling content
          is what makes a website work for your business. There are few pieces
          of content on your website that are more compelling than your mission,
          vision, values, and team. And all of these elements are typically
          found on the About page of your website.
